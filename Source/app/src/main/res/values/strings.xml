    <string name ="bio"> \n I am an engineering undergrad, \n pursuing Electronics and Communication Engineering at KLE Technolgical University.
        \n\nI am constantly working to enhance my problem solving skills and hold a great inclination towards Computer Science.
        \nI am a keen observer and I love to work on real world problems with an aim to reach the intersection
        \nof technology and social innovation.
        \n\nI believe that to identify these problems we must walk a mile in the shoes of those who are actually facing these problems out there. Being an engineer at heart and for the love of technology,
        \nI look forward to create an impact on the world by learning relevant concepts and creating unique projects by implementing my technichal skills to eventually fill the gaps in society.
        \n\nI am also a public speaker and seize every oppurtunity I get to interact with people in order to exchange ideas. \n\n</string>
